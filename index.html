                <h5>HTML and CSS</h5>
                <p>This landing page project is a one-page webpage based on HTML and CSS.
                    The HTML5 structure includes elements such as header, sidebar, section, footer, and more. In terms
                    of CSS, the project utilizes positioning, gradients, grid, and flexbox.
                    The color palette is chosen from Open-color, and the project's images are compressed, while icons
                    are selected from Heroicons in SVG format.</p>

                <h3>React Router Task</h3>
                <h5>HTML,CSS,Bootstrap and React</h5>
                <p>The objective of this task is to create a web page with routes using react-router-dom.</p>
                <p> When clicking on the links, a router in your web application can be configured to display
                    corresponding component. Each link corresponds to a specific route, and upon clicking, the
                    associated card component is rendered. For example, in a React application using react-router-dom,
                    you can define routes for each link and create components with the desired content. Links, such as
                    'Link 1' and 'Link 2', can be used to navigate to specific routes, triggering the display of
                    relevant content. This approach provides a structured way to organize and present information based
                    on user interactions</p>
